                            New York City (NYC), often called simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.[11] Located at the southern tip of the State of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass.[12] With almost 20 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area, it is one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce,[13] entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[14] New York is an important center for international diplomacy,[15][16] and has sometimes been nicknamed the capital of the world.[17][18]

                            Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of five boroughs, each of which is a county of the State of New York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island—were created when local governments were consolidated into a single city in 1898.[19] The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[20] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States,[21] the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.[22][23] As of 2019, the New York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion. If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest economy in the world. New York is home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.[24]

                            Statuia Libertății este situată în portul orașului New York pe mica insulă Liberty Island, la sud-est de Manhattan, la gura de vărsare a fluviului Hudson în oceanul Atlantic. Ea are un înveliș de cupru care acoperă un schelet de fier. Monumentul are o masă de 225 tone, culoarea statuii prin oxidarea cuprului a devenit verde. Soclul are o formă de stea fiind construit din piatră. În interiorul său se află un muzeu. Statuia reprezintă zeița libertății care stă cu un picior pe lanțul rupt al sclaviei. Zeița ține în mâna stângă o tablă cu inscripția cu cifre romane "JULY IV MDCCLXXVI", adică 4 iulie 1776, data când a fost ratificată Declarația de independență a Statelor Unite ale Americii. În mâna dreaptă zeița are o făclie cu flacăra aurită. Pe capul zeiței se află o coroană împodobită cu șapte fascicole de lumină și 25 de ferestre.
